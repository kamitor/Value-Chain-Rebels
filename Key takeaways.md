Reading up and watching of the movie dark waters we talked about last time. Key takeaways I can understand why the movie can be a good inspiration as it brings a narrative and history at hand. How it has been made and how it has been 

I'm a bit skeptical
Glisos ad - pestisides 
Monzanto - 
It's been legal actions against this, but we now know that it is bad, causing cancer and bad for evironment. 
our president; said that they would ban pfas;
Now you can't find it anymore but the consumers don't have access to it, but the farmers havn't changed, ultimately it doesnt matter. 
so my fear is here my skepticism if we look at these issue fromthe cosumer angle we will impact be minimal; We might come up with a solution that is too expensive for costumers.
and B) not targeting Pfas with the biggest companies

I was looking into new initiatives; 
I found out 92% of studies were not published in the open. Because researchers are afraid that it is misinterpeted.
The Green policy institute, 
In denmark it is banned, only in denmark, how to get more out of these research. Research things that already have been done.

The things are so bad that people have been instructed not to eat because of pollution

there is also new legislating coming in, where they are pushing it to be completly gone.
That it is so blatantly covered up. 

Bart;
a good example I found was from fire extingisers where people don't even know it's in their products.
How it's being percieved, the thing is super important. 
There is a lot of populistic information being spread; I think it's essential that we look into legal, if it's out of scope we shoudnt use it.
Is it required to put on your product if it's in it?
Or if it too low in percentage, and then we don't even list it.
The last thing again; the social aspect it, how much noise do you make about it. 

Similar to Lithium, > Slave laybor is not needed; Social media; aspects to the fact finding; 

SOCIAL MEDIA CAMPAIGN FOR AUDITING :D 
Half-Truth.
Everything that was being banned with Asbestos; 
>>> research asbestos.

We can zoom in consumer products - > Baby products ? health products, Value products. One paticular value chain. Whether it's health or outside gear. But if we do that, we can tackle this for the costumer angle.
